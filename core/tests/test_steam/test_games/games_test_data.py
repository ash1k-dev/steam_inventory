Take command of the Mobile Infantry and do your part in the war against the Arachnid threat.

Ensure that human civilization, not insect, dominates the galaxy now and always!<h2 class="bb_tag">Story Campaign</h2>The population of the harsh desert planet Kwalasha needs our help. Their daily lives of hard work in the mining industries has been disturbed by a new danger that they cannot face alone: the Arachnid. The Mobile Infantry will swiftly move in, take back control over the planet and smash everything that has more than two legs. Take part in this exciting military campaign, meet unique characters, see amazing locations and experience the heroic war against the Bug.<h2 class="bb_tag">Tactics &amp; Numbers</h2>While the Arachnids can rely on virtually limitless numbers, the Mobile Infantry must develop effective tactics to overcome this imbalance. Deploy your units at strategic locations to cover vital choke points and gain superior firepower through tactical use of elevation levels. Be wary, however, that battle mechanics such as True Line of Sight and True Line of Fire also allow Bugs to lay ambushes around every corner, as they are well known for their use of surprise attacks and deception.<h2 class="bb_tag">Units &amp; Abilities</h2>An expansive range of unique units are at your disposal, each with its own strengths, weaknesses and unlockable elite abilities. Squads of Rifle Troopers, for example, form the mainstay of your forces and can utilize “shotgun suppression” or “boom bundles” when they reach the elite experience level. Rocket Troopers on the other hand are specialists that deliver various types of deadly ordnance, ranging from armor-piercing and high-explosive warheads to incendiary and canister payloads.<br><br>As a campaign progresses, new technology buildings can be deployed to unlock the true potential of the Federation’s arsenal with E-Pulse rifles, TAC Fighter airstrikes, heavily armed Marauder bipedal vehicles, and many more developments optimized for spraying Bug ichor across the battlefield.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key features </h2><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>An immersive storyline campaign featuring unique missions, characters and a lot of Starship Troopers flavor.<br></li><li>Dozens of unique unit types, each with their own special abilities.<br></li><li>Terrain elevation, True Line of Sight &amp; True Line of Fire provide deep tactical gameplay.<br></li><li>Capture and hold vital radio stations, construct base defenses to repel Arachnid attacks and deploy technology buildings to unlock new weaponry.<br></li><li>Heroics, explosions, gore, and Bugs.
